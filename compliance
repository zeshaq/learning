Kubernetes Compliance


1. Compliance Goals

✅ Ensure regulatory adherence

🔒 Enforce security baselines

🧩 Maintain configuration consistency

🕵️‍♂️ Enable auditing and accountability

2. Compliance Frameworks
🧱 Common Industry Standards

CIS Benchmark

Kubernetes Security Hardening guidelines

Node, control plane, API server configurations

NIST 800-53 / 800-190

Cloud-native security and containerized environments

ISO 27001

Information security management

SOC 2

Security and operational controls for service orgs

PCI-DSS

Protecting cardholder data in cloud workloads

HIPAA

Healthcare data protection

3. Core Compliance Areas
🛠️ Configuration Management

Misconfigurations in manifests or YAMLs

Pod security (runAsNonRoot, privileged=false)

RBAC and API access controls

Admission controllers for policy enforcement

🧩 Security Controls

Image scanning

Network segmentation

Secret management (avoid plaintext secrets)

Logging and monitoring

🕵️‍♀️ Auditing & Monitoring

API audit logs

Kubernetes events

Audit pipelines (Fluent Bit, Loki, Elasticsearch)

4. Popular Tools
🧰 Policy & Governance

OPA (Open Policy Agent)

Rego language for writing compliance policies

Used in Gatekeeper, Kyverno

Kyverno

Policy engine native to Kubernetes (YAML-based)

Enforce pod security, labels, annotations

Kubewarden

WebAssembly-based policy controller

🧾 Benchmarking & Scanning

Kube-Bench (by Aqua Security)

Runs CIS Kubernetes Benchmark tests

CLI or automated CI/CD integration

Kube-Hunter (by Aqua Security)

Penetration testing tool for clusters

Detects exposed APIs and insecure configurations

Trivy (by Aqua Security)

Scans images, filesystems, and configs for vulnerabilities

Falco (by Sysdig)

Runtime security detection (syscalls, audit events)

🧩 Compliance Platforms

Kubescape (by ARMO)

Scans for misconfigurations and RBAC violations

Maps results to frameworks (CIS, NSA, MITRE)

NeuVector (by SUSE)

Container firewall and compliance auditing

Anchore Enterprise / Grype

Image compliance and vulnerability scanning

Aqua Security Platform

Full compliance and runtime protection suite

Prisma Cloud (by Palo Alto)

Policy as code and compliance dashboard

🧠 Multi-cluster Governance

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)

Centralized compliance and risk dashboard

Open Cluster Management (OCM)

Apply policies across clusters

Karmada

Federated management with policy propagation

5. Automation & Integration

CI/CD Gatekeeping

Enforce policies in pipelines (OPA/Kyverno in Tekton, GitLab, ArgoCD)

GitOps Integration

Continuous compliance enforcement with ArgoCD or Flux

Continuous Scanning

Regular scans of cluster state and workloads

6. Reporting & Visibility

Compliance Dashboards

Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

Centralized reports via ELK stack

Audit Trails

Kubernetes audit logs → Loki / Elasticsearch

Alerting

Falco / OPA violations trigger notifications via Slack, Email, SIEM

7. Best Practices

🧩 Use Namespace isolation for compliance zones

🔐 Enforce least privilege RBAC

📜 Enable API Server Auditing

🧱 Automate policy testing in CI/CD

🔁 Regularly re-run CIS Benchmarks

🧠 Implement continuous compliance monitoring
