Here’s a comprehensive checklist for taking a microservice application to production in Kubernetes. I’ve structured it in categories so you can go step by step:

1. Application Readiness

 Code quality & testing

Unit tests ✅

Integration tests ✅

End-to-end tests ✅

 Configuration management

Externalized configuration (ConfigMaps, Secrets)

Environment variables standardized

 Secrets management

Sensitive data stored in Kubernetes Secrets or external vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault)

Ensure encryption at rest for secrets

 Health checks

Liveness probes

Readiness probes

 Logging & metrics

Structured logging

Metrics exposed (Prometheus endpoints, OpenTelemetry)

 Error handling

Graceful shutdown

Retry policies

 Security

Input validation

Authentication/Authorization in place

Dependency vulnerability scans (Snyk, Trivy)

2. Containerization

 Container image

Minimal base image

Multi-stage builds to reduce image size

Tagged versions (avoid latest)

 Image scanning

Vulnerability scan on images

 Image registry

Secure registry access (credentials in Kubernetes secrets)

Immutable image tags

 Resource requests & limits

CPU/memory requests set

CPU/memory limits set

3. Kubernetes Deployment

 Namespaces

Use separate namespaces for dev, staging, and production

 Deployment strategies

Rolling updates / Blue-Green / Canary as needed

 Service exposure

ClusterIP for internal services

LoadBalancer or Ingress for external access

HTTPS enabled with valid certificates (TLS)

 ConfigMaps & Secrets

Mounted as env vars or files

Versioned when possible

 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Configure HPA based on CPU/memory or custom metrics

 Pod Disruption Budget

Minimum available pods defined

 Persistent storage

PersistentVolumeClaims for stateful services

StorageClass defined (replication, IOPS requirements)

 Service accounts & RBAC

Minimum permissions for each service

Avoid running containers as root

4. Networking

 Network policies

Restrict traffic between pods/services

 Ingress rules

Correct routing for multiple services

TLS termination

 Service discovery

Internal DNS naming standardized

 Load balancing

Test with expected traffic patterns

 Egress controls

Limit access to external resources

5. Observability

 Logging

Centralized log aggregation (ELK, Loki)

Log rotation configured

 Monitoring

CPU/memory, request latency, error rates

Alerts for critical thresholds

 Tracing

Distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)

 Dashboards

Grafana dashboards for key metrics

 Audit logs

Kubernetes audit enabled for sensitive actions

6. Reliability & Resilience

 Health checks (reiterated)

Liveness and readiness probes verified

 Circuit breakers & retries

If using service mesh or client-side logic

 Rate limiting

API Gateway or service mesh

 Backup & restore

Databases & critical data backup

Disaster recovery plan

 Chaos testing (optional)

Simulate failures to verify resiliency

7. CI/CD & Release

 Pipeline readiness

Automated build, test, and deploy

Rollback strategy configured

 GitOps (optional)

ArgoCD / Flux for declarative deployment

 Versioning

Semantic versioning of services

 Deployment gating

Manual approvals for production

8. Security & Compliance

 Image & cluster security

Scan images for CVEs

Ensure Kubernetes nodes patched

 Pod security

PodSecurityPolicies or OPA/Gatekeeper policies

 Secrets management

Rotate secrets regularly

 Network security

TLS for inter-service communication

NetworkPolicy enforcement

 Compliance checks

GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 if applicable

9. Performance & Scalability

 Load testing

Validate performance under expected and peak load

 Autoscaling

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Cluster autoscaler if using cloud provider

 Caching

Redis/Memcached configured for read-heavy services

 Database tuning

Connection pools

Read replicas if needed

10. Documentation & Runbooks

 Operational runbooks

How to restart pods, rollback, scale services

 Monitoring runbooks

How to troubleshoot alerts

 On-call guides

PagerDuty / Slack notifications

 Service catalog

API documentation
