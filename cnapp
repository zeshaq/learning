Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform.

CNAPP is a security platform designed to protect cloud-native applications across their entire lifecycle — from development to runtime — by combining multiple security functionalities in a single solution.

Think of it as “cloud-native security + DevSecOps + runtime protection” rolled into one.

2. Key Goals

Secure cloud workloads, containers, serverless functions, and Kubernetes clusters.

Detect misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

Provide threat detection and vulnerability management.

Integrate security early in the CI/CD pipeline (shift-left security).

3. Core Components / Features

A CNAPP typically combines several tools into one platform:

CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)

Ensures your cloud accounts, IAM policies, storage, and network are configured securely.

Detects misconfigurations and compliance violations.

CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)

Runtime protection for VMs, containers, and serverless workloads.

Includes malware detection, integrity monitoring, and behavioral analysis.

Vulnerability Management

Scans container images, serverless functions, and code for vulnerabilities.

IAM Security / Entitlement Management

Detects excessive privileges and identity risks.

Compliance & Audit

Continuous monitoring for standards like CIS, SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR.

Threat Detection & Response

Identifies attacks, misbehavior, or anomalous activities in real-time.

DevSecOps Integration

Shift-left security: integrates with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitLab, GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

4. Popular CNAPP Vendors

Palo Alto Prisma Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Trend Micro Cloud One

Check Point CloudGuard

Snyk (more developer-focused)

5. Why CNAPP is Important

Traditional security tools often focus only on runtime or only on cloud configuration.

CNAPP unifies security visibility, detection, and protection across the entire cloud-native stack.

Critical for multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.
